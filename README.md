make_contours: Alvarez 2023 Version.

This is a contour-making MATLAB script originally made by Tim Machado, Jessell Lab, Columbia University (C) 2015: see license.txt for details. 

Small edits were made to the original version by members of the Alvarez Lab (Ryan Wood and Andrew Worthy) to make contour images for Worthy et al. 2024, eLife (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.95172.2). Contact Andrew Worthy (aeworth@emory.edu) for any questions about this version.
